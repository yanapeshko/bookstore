Using react to develop a bookstore.

1. It should be a single page with book details, the main page should have a book list showing book name, price, category and a delete button at the end for each book. There should be an add button at the top so the user can add a book.
2. Once you click the add a book button, it should popup a page, let the user add a book ( name, price, category and description ).
3. The book should be clickable, if the user clicks the book, it will show a popup page, letting the user be able to modify the book name, price, category and description. After modification: the book details should be updated in the main page.
4. Once clicked delete button, the book should be deleted from the main page/

There is no need for a backend, just use an array to store the book list.
Requirements: Use redux and hooks for this test.
